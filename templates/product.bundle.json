            "content": "<p>RUBIES shaping products for bottoms such as our shaping underwear, bikini bottoms and one piece are designed to look and feel like regular stylish clothing that cis people are wearing.  <\/p><p>It should not be necessary to tuck or wear our bottoms super tight.  Ideally they fit comfortably: not too tight and not too loose.<\/p><p>Unlike tucking bottoms, they are not intended to completely “hide the bump”.  Instead they are designed to convert the pointy area to a more feminine mound. This is why they are extremely comfortable compared to any other products on the market.<\/p><p>If these are intended for your child who is struggling to feel comfortable in their RUBIES, it may be helpful to educate them that girls and women are not completely flat in this area either. Some of our community have reported it helpful to browse together online through pictures of girls and women in leggings.<\/p><p>RUBIES shaping products for up top such as our bras, bikini top and one-piece have two slits in the chest area that can be used to add multiple inserts like the RUBIES shaping chest pads. This is perfect for those that are experimenting with shaping up top.<\/p><p>Our tops are made to accommodate a slightly wider torso.  Our bra has adjustable straps and clasps.  The bra strap is stretchy enough to allow the bra to be put on without using a clasp, as some people new to bras can find this daunting.<\/p><p>Do not hesitate to reach out to us at hello@rubyshines.com if you have any further questions about how any of our products work or any suggestions about how we can make them even better.<\/p>",
